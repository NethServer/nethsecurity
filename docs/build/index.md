# Build system

* TOC
{:toc}


---

NethSecurity runs the [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) build system inside a rootless [podman](https://podman.io/) container.
This allows to build the images in a reproducible and isolated environment.
The container image is named [builder](#builder-image).

## Automatic builds (GitHub CI)

Automatic builds run inside [GitHub actions](https://github.com/NethServer/nethsecurity/actions)
on every pull request (PR), git push and git merge.
The build runs inside a [GitHub self-hosted runner](#self-hosted-runner).

The GitHub actions also take care of publishing images and packages to the repository. The current logic is the following:

- If the branch is `main`, the image will be built and published to the `dev` [channel](/design/distfeed/#channels).
- If the branch is `main` and the tag is a stable version, the image will be built and published to the `stable` channel.
- If the branch is other than `main`, the image will be built but not published to the repository.
  Instead, an artifact will be created and available for download from the GitHub actions page for 90 days.

### Build targets

By default, the CI will build the `x86_64` target. To build a different target, you need to select an alternate
target from the [GitHub actions page](https://github.com/NethServer/nethsecurity/actions/workflows/build-image.yml).

Click the `Run workflow` button and select the target from the `target` drop-down.
Please note that occasionally, when changing the target architecture, the build system may fail the build.
In such cases, it is recommended to delete the podman `nethsecurity-build_dir` volume and retry the build.

Currently supported targets:
- x86_64
- [Lamobo BananaPi R1](https://openwrt.org/toh/hwdata/lamobo/lamobo_bananapi_r1)

## Build locally

To build images locally on your machine, make sure these minimum requirements are met:

- Linux distribution with Podman 3.x
- 2GB or more of RAM
- at least 40GB of free disk space
- 4 or more CPU cores

Tested on Debian 11, Fedora 35/36/37 and Ubuntu 23.10.

Clone the repository, then to start the build just execute:
```
./run
```

The script will create a `bin` directory inside the current working directory.
At the end, the `bin` directory will contain the output of the build.
If a previous `bin` directory already exists, it will be renamed to `bin.bak`.
If a previous `bin.bak` directory already exists, it will be removed.

To speed up successive builds, the script will also create `staging_dir` and `build_dir` directories as cache.
To avoid cache creation, pass the `--no-cache` option: `./run --no-cache`.

If you need a shell inside the build container, execute:
```
./run bash
```

During the start-up, the container will:

- generate the diffconfig
- generate a random public key to sign packages

### Environment variables

The `run` script behavior can be changed using the following environment variables:

- `IMAGE_TAG`: specify the image tag of the builder; if not set default is `latest`, the special value `snapshot` will build a snapshot from the OpenWrt main branch
- `USIGN_PUB_KEY` and `USIGN_PRIV_KEY`: see [package signing section](#package-signing)
   with the given keys
- `NETIFYD_ACCESS_TOKEN`: GitLab private access token; if set, download and compile netifyd closed
   source plugins
- `TARGET`: specify the target to build; if not set default is `x86_64`

The `USIGN_PUB_KEY`, `USIGN_PRIV_KEY` and `NETIFYD_ACCESS_TOKEN` variables are always set as secrets
inside the CI pipeline, but for [security reasons](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#accessing-secrets)
they are not accessible when building pull requests.

### Using an alternate builder

If you need to use a modified version of the builder image, edit the files inside the `builder` 
directory.
Then build the image and use it with the `run` script:
```
./builder/build-builder
declare IMAGE_TAG="mybranch"
TAG=$(podman images --quiet ghcr.io/nethserver/nethsecurity-builder:latest)
podman tag $TAG ghcr.io/nethserver/nethsecurity-builder:$IMAGE_TAG
./run
```

### Build locally for a release

If you need to build some packages locally for a release, make sure the following environment variables are set:
- `USIGN_PUB_KEY` and `USIGN_PRIV_KEY`: make sure to read the whole key file using `cat` and set the content as the environment variable
- `NETIFYD_ACCESS`: required to download and compile netifyd closed source plugins

Then execute the `run` script:
```
NETIFYD_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx USIGN_PUB_KEY=$(cat nethsecurity-pub.key) USIGN_PRIV_KEY=$(cat nethsecurity-priv.key) ./run 
```

See the [manual release process](../development_process/#manually-releasing-packages) for more info.

### Build locally a snapshot

A snapshot is a build that is based on OpenWrt main branch.

To build a snapshot locally, follow these steps:

1. Build the image builder based on main branch:
   ```
   pushd builder
   OWRT_VERSION=snapshot ./build-builder
   popd
   ```
   This will create an image named `ghcr.io/nethserver/nethsecurity-builder:snapshot` that will be used to build the output image

2. Build the image using the builder:
    ```
    IMAGE_TAG=snapshot ./run
    ```
    Since multiple versions of OpenWrt can't be built using the same directory, the snaphost build will use
    different podman volume named with `_snapshot` suffix, like `nethsecurity-build_dir_snapshot`

## Versioning

The versioning system encompasses three types of versions:

- **Stable:** Stable versions, finalized and ready for production use. 
- **Unstable:** Versions under active development, intended for testing and continuous development.
- **Development:** Versions in active development, with additional commit details, used for debugging and internal testing.


The generic format for a version is as follows:

```
<owrt_release>-ns.<nethsecurity_release>-<commit_since_last_tag>-g<commit_hash>
```

- `<owrt_release>`: Main version number of OpenWRT.
- `<nethsecurity_release>`: NethSecurity security version in [semver](https://semver.org/) format.
- `<commit_since_last_tag>`: Number of commits since the last version tag, present only in development versions.
- `g<commit_hash>`: Unique identifier for the current commit, present only in development versions.


Stable version example:
```
8-20.05-ns.1.2.0
```

Unstable version example
```
8-20.05-ns.0.1.0-alpha1
```

Development version example:
```
8-20.05-ns.0.0.1-224-g26d3f78
```

## Upstream version change

Create a tag that contains the new OpenWrt release followed by a NethSecurity unstable release.

Example:
```
git tag 23.05.2-ns.0.0.1-alpha1
git push --tags
```

When the builder of the image has been completed, make sure to:
- wipe podman volumes, otherwise the build will fail:
  ```
  podman volume rm nethsecurity-build_dir nethsecurity-staging_dir
  ```
- rebuild the image using the latest builder container image
- rebuild the documentation to update the download link: https://readthedocs.org/projects/nethsecurity-docs/

## Image configuration

### OpenWrt configuration

All files with `.conf` extension inside the `config` directory will be merged to create the diffconfig.
The `.conf` files must respect the syntax of OpenWrt `.config` file.

Best practices:

- create a `.conf` file for each image customization
- add comments to the conf file to explain why an option has been set

See [config diff file](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-buildsystem#configure_using_config_diff_file) for more info.

### Target configuration

Target configuration is defined inside the `targets` directory under the `config` directory.
Each target is a configuration named after the target architecture, like `x86_64.conf`.

During the build process, the target will be selected using the `TARGET` environment variable.

To add a new target:
- create a new `.conf` file inside the `targets` directory
- add the new target name inside the [GitHub actions workflow file](https://github.com/NethServer/nethsecurity/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-image.yml)
  under the `inputs` section

### Custom files

All files from the `files` directory will be copied inside the final image.

To setup a UCI default, just put a file inside `files/etc/uci-defaults`.

See [UCI  defaults](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/uci-defaults) for more info.

### Custom packages

All new packages can be added inside the `packages` directory.

See [packages doc](../packages/).

### Package patches

Some packages do not have sources that can be patched using [quilt](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/toolchain/use-patches-with-buildsystem).
To patch an existing package put a patch inside the `patches` directory, reflecting the structure of the `feeds` directory.

The patch can be created following these steps:

- run the build system in interactive mode
- enter the package directory to edit
- generate a patch and copy it outside the container

First, enter the build system by executing `./run bash`, then enter the directory package to edit. Example:
```
cd /home/build/openwrt/feeds/packages/net/adblock
```

Edit the files, then generate the patch using `git`:
```
cd /home/build/openwrt
mkdir -p patches/feeds/packages
git -C feeds/packages diff > patches/feeds/packages/100-adblock-bypass.patch
```

Finally, copy the patch outside the container and run the build.

Note: before submitting a patch using this method, please try to open a pull request to the upstream repository!

### Override upstream packages

It is possible to replace upstream packages with local ones.
This is useful when you want to use a more recent version than the one already
released by OpenWrt.

To replace an upstream package just create a new package with the same
name inside the `packages` directory.

### LuCI web interface fork

Some configurations should not be changed from LuCI to avoid problems on the underlying system.
This is the reason why, during the build, a fork of LuCI will be used.
The fork is hosted at the following [repository](https://github.com/NethServer/luci).

{% assign vparts = site.version | split:'.' %}
Please make changes only to the `nethsec-{{ vparts | slice: 0,2 | join:'.' }}` branch.

LuCI fork is updated on every build run.
The original GIT commit used during the build can be found with this command:
```
opkg info luci | grep Version | cut -d'-' -f3
```

### Package signing

All packages are signed with the following public key generated with [OpenBSD signify](nethsecurity-pub.key).

Public key fingerprint: `7640d16662de3b89`

Public key content:
```
untrusted comment: NethSecurity sign key
RWR2QNFmYt47ieK7g/zEPwgk+MN8bHsA2vFnPThSpnLZ48L7sh6wxB/f
```

To sign the packages, just execute the `run` script with the following environment variables:
- `USIGN_PUB_KEY`
- `USIGN_PRIV_KEY`

Usage example:
```
USIGN_PUB_KEY=$(cat nethsecurity-pub.key) USIGN_PRIV_KEY=$(cat nethsecurity-priv.key) ./run
```

If the above environment variables are not set, the build system will generate a local temporary signing key.
Builds executed inside CI will sign the packages with the correct key.

### Netifyd plugins

NethSecurity uses two [netifyd](https://gitlab.com/netify.ai/public/netify-agent) proprietary plugins from [Netify](https://www.netify.ai/):

- Netify Flow Actions Plugin (netify-flow-actions)
- Netify Agent Stats Plugin (netify-plugin-stats)

The plugins should be used with the latest netifyd stable version (4.4.3 at the time of writing).
To create the files for the build, follow the steps below. Such steps should be needed only after a netifyd/plugin version change.

Both plugins source code is hosted on a private repository at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).
To access it, you must set `_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_` from GitLab.
During build time, if `_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_` is not set, the final image
will not contain any of these plugins.

Prepare the environment:
```
sudo apt install -y  libcurl4-openssl-dev libmnl-dev libnetfilter-conntrack-dev libpcap-dev zlib1g-dev pkg-config bison flex uuid-runtime libnftables-dev
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/netify.ai/public/netify-agent.git
```

Setup netifyd version:
```
export NETIFY_ROOT=$(pwd)/netify-root
cd netify-agent
git checkout v4.2.2 -b latest
./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
make DESTDIR=${NETIFY_ROOT} -j $(nproc) install
cd ..
```

Setup netify-flow-actions plugin:
```
git clone https://oauth2:_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_@gitlab.com/netify.ai/private/nethesis/netify-flow-actions.git
cd netify-flow-actions
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${NETIFY_ROOT}/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:${NETIFY_ROOT}/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig
 export CPPFLAGS=$(pkg-config --define-variable=includedir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/include --define-variable=libdir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/lib libnetifyd --cflags)
export LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config --define-variable=includedir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/include --define-variable=libdir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/lib libnetifyd --libs-only-L)
./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
unset PKG_CONFIG_PATH
unset CPPFLAGS
unset LDFLAGS
cd ..
```

Setup netify-plugin-stats plugin:
```
git clone https://oauth2:_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_@gitlab.com/netify.ai/private/nethesis/netify-agent-stats-plugin.git
cd netify-agent-stats-plugin
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${NETIFY_ROOT}/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:${NETIFY_ROOT}/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig
 export CPPFLAGS=$(pkg-config --define-variable=includedir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/include --define-variable=libdir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/lib libnetifyd --cflags)
export LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config --define-variable=includedir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/include --define-variable=libdir=${NETIFYD_PREFIX}/usr/lib libnetifyd --libs-only-L)
./autogen.sh && ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
unset PKG_CONFIG_PATH
unset CPPFLAGS
unset LDFLAGS
cd ..
```

Copy files to the package directories:
```
mkdir -vp packages/net/netifyd/files
cp netify-agent/deploy/openwrt/Makefile packages/net/netifyd/
shopt -s extglob
cp netify-agent/deploy/openwrt/files/!(*.in) packages/net/netifyd/files/

mkdir -p nspackages/netify-flow-actions/
cp netify-flow-actions/deploy/openwrt/Makefile nspackages/netify-flow-actions/
cp netify-flow-actions/deploy/openwrt/Config.in nspackages/netify-flow-actions/

mkdir -p nspackages/netify-plugin-stats/files
cp netify-agent-stats-plugin/deploy/openwrt/Makefile nspackages/netify-plugin-stats/
cp netify-agent-stats-plugin/deploy/netify-plugin-stats.json nspackages/netify-plugin-stats/files/
```

Setup Makefile to use a local copy of private repositories:
```
sed -i 's/PKG_SOURCE_URL.*$/PKG_SOURCE_URL:=file:\/\/\/home\/build\/openwrt\/netify-flow-actions/' nspackages/netify-flow-actions/Makefile
sed -i 's/PKG_SOURCE_URL.*$/PKG_SOURCE_URL:=file:\/\/\/home\/build\/openwrt\/netify-agent-stats-plugin/' nspackages/netify-plugin-stats/Makefile
```

To manually build the stack, use:
```
make -j $(nproc) package/feeds/packages/netifyd/{download,compile} V=sc
make -j $(nproc) package/feeds/nethsecurity/netify-plugin-stats/{download,compile} V=sc
make -j $(nproc) package/feeds/nethsecurity/netify-flow-actions/{download,compile} V=sc
```


## Builder image

The `nethserver/nethsecurity-builder` is a container image to build nethsecurity.
It's based on `debian-slim` and contains an OpenWrt build environment ready to be used.

### How to build it

Additional requirements:

- buildah

Execute:
```
cd builder
./build-builder
```

Publish the image:
```
buildah login ghcr.io
buildah push ghcr.io/nethserver/nethsecurity-builder docker://ghcr.io/nethserver/nethsecurity-builder
```

## Self-hosted runner

The build system uses a GitHub-hosted runner to build the images.

Before proceeding, make sure that your hosted runner is fast enough to build the images.
The runner should have:
- 8GB or more of RAM
- a fast NVME disk
- at least 100GB of free disk space
- 8 or more CPU cores
- a fast internet connection

To setup a self-hosted runner, follow the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).
To setup a self-hosted runner on Ubuntu 23.10, follow the steps below.

First, create the user `runner1` and install podman and git. Then, create the systemd service:
```
apt-get install podman git -y
useradd runner1 -s /bin/bash -m
loginctl enable-linger runner1
cat <<EOF > /etc/systemd/system/runner1.service
[Unit]
Description=GitHub Actions runner1
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/runner1/actions-runner/run.sh
User=runner1
WorkingDirectory=/home/runner1/actions-runner
KillMode=process
KillSignal=SIGTERM
TimeoutStopSec=5min

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Then, login as `runner1` and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/NethServer/nethsecurity/settings/actions/runners/new) to download
and register the runner.
   
Finally, as root, enable and start the service:
```
systemctl enable --now runner1
```

The build_dir directory also keeps old versions, which speeds up the builds but quickly fills up the machine's disk.
On a fast machine, cleaning the build_dir reduces the execution time from around 7-10 minutes to 20-22 minutes.

Since OpenWrt documentation suggests performing a "make clean" occasionally, and to avoid filling up the disk, a cron job is set up to clean the build_dir weekly:
```
echo 'runuser  -s /usr/bin/env -l runner1 podman volume rm nethsecurity-build_dir' > /etc/cron.weekly/nethsec-cleanup.sh
chmod a+x /etc/cron.weekly/nethsec-cleanup.sh
```
